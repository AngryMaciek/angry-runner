# Angry Runner (üò†üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è)

Delicious recipe for a Docker image suitable for: (1) self-hosted GitHub Actions runners, (2) local development environment as well as (3) GitHub codespaces base for the devcontainer mechanism.

Enjoy!

_~AngryMaciek_


### Brief description

The base image here is the popular `ubuntu:22:04` - that is to increase the similarity of the container system to users OSs; A few system tools come pre-installed: [GNU Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/), [gcc & g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/), [Git](https://git-scm.com/), [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/), [CMake](https://cmake.org/), [Vim](https://www.vim.org/) and most importantly - [mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge), which has been set up for the (default) root user; port `8888` is exposed to the host machine; dir `/workspace` is available to mount a volume; an entrypoint script has been designed to add a new non-root linux user which can access conda via a system's group; executing commands as `angryuser` is available through [gosu](https://github.com/tianon/gosu).

### Actions runner

In order to execute your CI job on a self-hosted runner in a Docker container please specify:

```yaml
  job:

    runs-on: "self-hosted"
    container:
      image: angrymaciek/angry-runner:latest
      options: --rm=true # cleanup
    defaults:
      run:
        shell: bash # recognise source

    steps:

      # Commands from the ci steps are executed in a non-interactive non-login shell;
      # conda is not initialised there thus every job step with a 'run' directive
      # needs to start with loading conda.
      # PS. base env is not activated automatically
      - name: info
        run: |
          source /mambaforge/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
          conda activate base
          conda info -a
```

### Local development

(Provided you have a Docker engine installed and set up)

In order to build a container please clone this repository and execute `docker build`:

```bash
cd $HOME
git clone https://github.com/AngryMaciek/angry-runner.git
docker build -f angry-runner/Dockerfile -t angrymaciek/angry-runner:latest angry-runner
```

Alternatively to building yourself you can pull the container from the DockerHub:

```bash
docker pull angrymaciek/angry-runner:latest
```

Run the container with:

```bash
docker run --name angry-runner -e HOSTUID=`id -u $USER` -p 8888:8888 -it -v $HOME:/workspace angrymaciek/angry-runner:latest
```

In the example above my whole home directory is mounted as the volume.  
This may, of course, be adjusted.

### Codespaces (devcontainer)

The following repository is configured to push each new version of the image
to my DockerHub. Feel free to use it as a base for your development
container through the `devcontainer` mechanism; include these lines in your JSON:

```json
  "image": "angrymaciek/angry-runner:latest",
  "postCreateCommand": "bash /bin/entrypoint.sh",
```

By default the container starts as root, though one may swiftly change
to the developer shell with: `gosu angryuser bash`.
